# The Second Project "We Rate Dogs"
In this project, the purpose is to wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create analyses and visualizations.

Data wrangled through 3 main steps:

[1] Gathering data, through:
- Twitter Archive Enanced.csv file : given.
- Tweet-json.txt : Twitter API.
- image-predictions.tsv : downloaded from a given URL using requests.

[2] Assessing data, through:
- Visually: by inspection the three dataframes heads and tails to find the obvious quality and tidiness issues.
- Programmatically: by using codes and functions such as: info(), value_counts() and duplicated(), ... etc.

[3] Cleaning data:
- From quality issues such as: columns names typos, inaccurate data, wrong columns data type, ... etc.
- From tidiness issues such as: the whole data is separated into 3 different dataframes, creating 2 obvious cloumns from 9 separated columns, ... etc.


After data wrangling, it's analyzied and visualized with plots.
